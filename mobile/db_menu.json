      "description": "This course is designed to enhance or broaden the knowledge and skill of engine personnel, particularly engineers in common welding practices available on board.\n\nParticipants in this course will undergo hands-on training that enhances their knowledge and skill in welding operation and how to assess the quality of weld in accordance with industry standards.  It covers competency such as Weld Carbon steel Plates using various welding processes such as Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW), Oxygen-acetylene Welding (OAW), Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG), and Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding processes, which they can actually perform for them to experience the real pace of operation.  The kinds of electrodes, properties of metal to be welded, heat treatment, hard facing and rebuilding of metals will be taken in Basic Welding Metallurgy. The use and characteristics of different kinds of electrodes are also discussed in the course.  The application safety practices, use of hand tools, prepare weld materials, setup welding equipment, fit-up weld materials, repair welds, brazing and oxyacetylene cutting are also included.\t\nThe modules enumerated below shall be given appropriate time allocation both for theoretical preparation and for practical application of the competencies.",
